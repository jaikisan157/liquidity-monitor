1️⃣ Account Entity + Table
2️⃣ Balance Tracking
3️⃣ Payment Processing API
4️⃣ Kafka (later, step-by-step)
5️⃣ Liquidity calculations

Real-Time Liquidity & Payments Monitoring Platform– Designed and implemented a backend system to track account balances, payment flows, and firm-wide liquidity in real time. 
Built RESTful APIs using Java Spring Boot for account management, payment initiation, and transaction processing.
Implemented Apache Kafka to stream transaction events and asynchronously recalculate liquidity metrics.
Applied idempotency, retry mechanisms, and exception handling to ensure reliable payment processing.
Modeled relational schemas in PostgreSQL with transactional consistency and optimized queries.

PHASE 1 — CORE BACKEND (NOW)

No Kafka yet. No complexity.

You’ll build:

REST APIs

Database entities

Business logic

Balance updates

PHASE 2 — PAYMENTS LOGIC

Payment initiationN

Debit / Credit logicN

Validation (insufficient funds)

Idempotency (no double payments)

PHASE 3 — REAL-TIME FEEL

Event-driven updates

Liquidity recalculation

(Later) Kafka

PHASE 4 — PRODUCTION QUALITY

Error handling

Logging

Clean architecture
